Here I experimented with 3d graphics and my adventure led me to building a "Minecraft clone"

Look how awesome it looks in night time with that purple light!

my lighting is still in progress (as well as 99% of the project) at the moment you will see the light on blocks hidden from the light source as well but I might fix that in the future.

Look at a video of the world! (size 32*32 chunks where each chunk is 16x16x256 blocks)
